#  Passing the Bechdel-Mako Bar: How Cinema Stacks Up on Gender Representation

### Overview

Welcome to the repository for *Passing the Bechdel-Mako Bar: How Cinema Stacks Up on Gender Representation*, the final project for the Introduction to Data Science chair at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). This repository contains all the codes, data, and resources used to build the project, which examines gender representation in cinema using both the Bechdel and the Mako Mori Tests as primary evaluation tools.

***

### Repository Structure

> **/data:** Contains raw and processed data collected from (insert api names and whatever here).
> 
> **/scripts:** Includes all scripts used for data collection, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.  A /requirements.txt file and further instructions are provided to ensure replicability.
> 
> **/results:** Contains the output of all analyses, including: visualizations (graphs showing trends in gender representation), statistical results (outputs from tests such as Chi-Square and regression analysis) and summary tables of key findings.

### Data

Our project uses data from the following sources:

- Bechdel Test API: Determines whether films pass the Bechdel Test based on three criteria.
- OMDb: Provides metadata such as title, release year, genre, and country.
-  OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo API

To ensure replicability, `/data` also:
1. Explains the data extraction process from the various APIs and methods used and
2. Describes all the mathematical and statistical tests conducted in the project, providing a quantitative, evidence-based evaluation of the data

### Scripts

For the best use of the scripts found on this repository, you should start by checking the `\requirements.txt` file found in this directory.
We advise you to grab the data sample to compile your code or to extract your own data by your own parameters/needs/filters as instructed at /data.

**Key scripts include:**

- `makomori_label.py`: Classifies each film in the dataset as "pass" or "fail" based on the Mako Mori test criteria.
- `mathRQ1.py` and `mathRQ2.py`: Runs various statistical tests, such as the Chi-Square Test and the Odds Ratio Test. Further explanation and listing of all tests can be found at /data.

### Results

The results of the analysis, including all visualizations and summary tables, are available in the `/results` directory. These are organized by the specific research questions addressed in the study.
